        <h3>Are dogs colour blind?</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="info">
        <p>
          Having yellow-blue dichromatic vision means that dogs are most similar
          to a red-green color blind person. They are very good at
          distinguishing between variations of blues and yellows (and whites and
          grays), but cannot really see red and green all that well.

        <h3>What country has the most vending machines per capita?</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="info">
        <p>
          Japan. Manufacturers lend vending machines free of charge that's why
          it skyrocketed in Japan. Anyone can install vending machines as long
          as permissions were already acquired.
