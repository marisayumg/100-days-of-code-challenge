## Description

A simple game where you need to get the same value for all ten dices as fast as you can.


## Requirements

1. Start with 10 random numbers (between 1-6 as dice would);
2. Press "Roll" button to reroll the numbers;
3. Press any number to hold that dice in place, so it will not get rerolled;
4. When all numbers are the same, the user won! (throw in confetti for celebration)
